# Ruby on Rails Tutorial sample application

This is the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](https://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

## Getting started
To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:
```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
